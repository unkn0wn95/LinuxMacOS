# Windows-compatible variants
Bold, Bold Italic and Italic are not properly recognized by Windows because of the incompatible font metadata that works for macOS (and Linux).  
Office apps don't support other variants than Bold, Bold Italic and Italic. This also fixes that.

## Text or Display?
Normally, Display is recommended because its kerning is quite the same as Georgia (Pro). If Display is too difficult to read in small sizes, consider using Text.
