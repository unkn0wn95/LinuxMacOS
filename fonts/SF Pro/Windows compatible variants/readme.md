# Windows-compatible variants
Bold, Bold Italic and Italic are not properly recognized by Windows because of the incompatible font metadata that works for macOS (and Linux).  
Office apps don't support other variants than Bold, Bold Italic and Italic. This also fixes that.

## Text or Display?
Bigger size: Display, starts at 20-21px.  
Smaller size: Text.

Ultralight is not recommended for small size on Windows screen. It looks horrible.
