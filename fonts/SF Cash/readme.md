# SF Cash
New typeface appeared in Apple Pay in [Wallet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Wallet) app. There are 3 fonts in this family: **SF Cash Chiseled**, **SF Cash Plain** and **SF Cash Text Condensed Semibold**. **Chiseled** and **Plain** are Apple OpenType-SVG color font types so you cannot open them on Windows, you still can open them in Adobe Photoshop or try in latest Chrome/Firefox/Edge version.  
**Plain** is just a black version of **Chiseled**, which is already covered in **SF Cash Text Condensed Semibold**.
